    "    - Very shell like.\n",
    " * No brackets around the `echo`.\n",
    "    - Well... autohotkey does it. Is this actually just a shell?\n",
    " * `var` for defining variables, colon typing style.\n",
    "    - Explict typed declarations are surprising given the loose syntax.\n",
    " * `string` is native.\n",
    "    - No char arrays here!\n",
    " * Commas used in string building.\n",
    "    - Or not... are they seperate parameters?\n",
    " * Standard functions exist already without an import.\n",
    "    - Probably for the best, having import your standard library every time just adds boilerplate.\n",
    " * camelCase is used\n",
    "    - Interesting... I haven't seem many languages explictly use this lately.\n",
    " * Brackets *are* used for readLine.\n",
    "    - What's the rule here???\n",
    " * `stdin` is an object\n",
    "    - How would I access its properties?\n",
